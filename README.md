## 📋 Testing

**TripSafe** has been rigorously tested using:

- **Chrome Dev Tools (Lighthouse):** Performance and accessibility analysis.
- **W3 Markup Validation Service:** Ensures HTML validity.
- **W3 CSS Validation Service:** Validates CSS stylesheets.

Using the above resources I will test all individual pages and note all bugs found in Bugs & Fixes. I will also use peer code review within the slack community and my colleagues for a "fresh set of eyes" to help pick out any issues I may miss.

With the vigorous testing and fresh eyes I hope to cover all issues that may arise and implement fast fixes.
